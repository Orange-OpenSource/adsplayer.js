When opening a new stream with hasplayer.js, the adsplayer.js plugin handles ad-insertion in the case a MAST file URL is provided. The adsplayer.js plugin takes charge of: MAST and VAST files downloading detecting ad-insertion triggers pausing and then resuming the main player video when playing ad(s) opening and playing ad media files, by the help of &lt;video&gt; and &lt;img&gt; HTML components, created by the plugin and appended in the DOM container provided to the plugin The application that uses hasplayer.js in conjunction with adsplayer.js has to take charge of: hiding/showing adsplayer.js components according to the events raised by the plugin opening the web page when a click on the playing ad has been detected by the plugin pausing/resuming the plugin (for example when application visibility changes) Build / Run# npm run buildThe resulting built file adsplayer.js has to be included along with hasplayer.js. ReleasesThe project releases are available at this address: http://orange-opensource.github.io/adsplayer.js Getting StartedWhen creating the hasplayer.js's MediaPlayer instance, create an AdsPlayer instance and add it to the MediaPlayer. The DOM element in which &lt;video&gt; and &lt;img&gt; HTML components will be appended for playing ad(s) has to be provided in the constuctor. var mediaPlayer = new MediaPlayer(); var adsPlayer = new adsplayer.AdsPlayer(document.getElementById('adsplayer-container')); mediaPlayer.addPlugin(adsPlayer);When opening a stream with the MediaPlayer, the MAST file URL has to be provided in the 'adsUrl' stream parameter. var stream = { url: &quot;http://playready.directtaps.net/smoothstreaming/SSWSS720H264/SuperSpeedway_720.ism/Manifest&quot;, adsUrl: &quot;&lt;mast-file-url&gt;&quot; }; mediaPlayer.load(stream);In order to interact with AdsPlayer, the application has to register to some events raised by the AdsPlayer: adsPlayer.addEventListener(&quot;start&quot;, function (e) { // Ad(s) playback is starting =&gt; the application shall show ad(s) player container and hide main video }); adsPlayer.addEventListener(&quot;end&quot;, function (e) { // Ad(s) playback has ended =&gt; the application shall hide ad(s) player container and show main video }); adsPlayer.addEventListener(&quot;addElement&quot;, function (e) { // A DOM element for playing an ad has been created and will be appended in the ads player container. The element can be either a &lt;video&gt; or an &lt;img&gt; element }); adsPlayer.addEventListener(&quot;removeElement&quot;, function (e) { // the DOM element for playing an ad is being removed from the ads player container and deleted }); adsPlayer.addEventListener(&quot;play&quot;, function (e) { // An ad's media playback is starting =&gt; the application should update play/pause button }); adsPlayer.addEventListener(&quot;pause&quot;, function (e) { // An ad's media playback is paused =&gt; the application should update play/pause button }); adsPlayer.addEventListener(&quot;click&quot;, function (e) { // A click has beed detected on the media component =&gt; the application shall open the corresponding web page, which URL is contained in parameter e.data.uri });AdsPlayer propose some more specific API methods in order to interact with the ad(s) playing: adsPlayer.pause(); // Pause the playback of the current ad media adsPlayer.play(); // Play/resume the playback of the current ad mediaLicenseAll code in this repository is covered by the BSD-3 license.
